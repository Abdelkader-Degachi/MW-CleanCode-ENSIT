//Q1: With this function we want to check if a1 is higher than a2 and less than a3 (No meaningful variables)
function isValueInTheRange(value: Number, InferiorBorn: Number, SuperiorBorn: Number): boolean {
  return InferiorBorn <= value && value <= SuperiorBorn;
}


//Q2: We want to have student type with some information. (If it's not pronounceable how you will say it)
type Student = {
  studentName: string;
  studentClass: string;
  studentId: number;
}



//Q3: What we should call our function that return User?

getUser(); 



//Q4: We want to check if that our student yearly grade is acceptable for any country Education System (in Tunisia <20, in USA 100)
function isGradeWithinRange(grade: number, maxGrade: number): boolean {
  return grade >= 0 && grade <= maxGrade;
}


//Q5: I know you got the idea of variable names but I want it to be clear for anyone around the world.
Student student = new Student();
Grade grade = new Grade();
Professor professor = new Professor();


//Q6: Don't you think we are overdoing it???
 no, because later in the code is better to find StudentId that references to a student than an id that can refers to any object

Type Student {
    studentFirstName: string;
    studentLastName: string;
    StudentId: number;
}


//Q7: What we can do to avoid giving unappropriat gender value? (Hint enum)

enum Gender {
    Male,
    Female
}

type Student {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    id: number;
    gender: Gender;
}

function displayStudentName(student: Student) {
    switch (student.gender) {
        case Gender.Male:
            console.log("Mr." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
            break;
        case Gender.Female:
            console.log("Mrs." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
            break;
        default:
            console.log("ERROR 404");
    }
}


//Q8: Is it good idea to display all these arguments in one line like this?
 no it's hard to detect all of them
displayUserDetails(student: Student, department: String, university: String){
// Some logic happens here
}



//Q9: Is it good idea to give all these arguments to one function?
 no it's hard to detect all of them
displayUserDetails(student: Student, department: String, university: String){
}



//Q10: Who wants to have a function that do multiple things with multiple comments?
