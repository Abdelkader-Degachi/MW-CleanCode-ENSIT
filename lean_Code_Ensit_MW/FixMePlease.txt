//Q1: With this function we want to check if a1 is higher than a2 and less than a3 (No meaningful variables)
function compare(middleNum: Number, lowerBound: Number, higherBound: Number): boolean {
  return lowerBound <= middleNum && middleNum <= higherBound;
}

//Q2: We want to have student type with some information. (If it's not pronounceable how you will say it)
type student = {
  firstName: String;
  lastName: String;
  age: number;
}

//Q3: What we should call our function that return User?
getUserData();
getUser(); (********this one*******)
getUserInformation();

//Q4: We want to check if that our student yearly grade is acceptable for any country Education System (in Tunisia <20, in USA 100)
const gradeMaxTunisia = 20
const gradeMaxUSA = 100 
isGradeBelowMax(grade, gradeMaxTunisia)

//Q5: I know you got the idea of variable names but I want it to be clear for anyone around the world.
Student student = new Student();
Grade studentGrade = new Grade();
Professor professor = new Professor();

//Q6: Don't you think we are overdoing it???
Type Student {
studentFirstName: String;
studentLastName: String;
StudentId: Number;
} 
No, firstName and lastName can refer to the student's parents ..

//Q7: What we can do to avoid giving unappropriat gender value? (Hint enum)

enum Gender {
  MALE = 'male',
  FEMALE = 'female',
  OTHER = 'other',
}
Type Student {
firstName: String;
lastName: String;
Id: Number;
Gender: String;
}

function displayName(student: Student){
switch (student.gender) {
    case "Male":
        console.log("Mr." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
        break;
    case "Female":
        console.log("Mrs." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
        break;
    Default:
        console.log("ERROR 404");
    }
}

//Q8: Is it good idea to display all these arguments in one line like this?
displayUserDetails(
			       firstName: String,
			       lastName: String,
			       id: Number,
			       department: String,
			       university: String)
{
// Some logic happens here
}

//Q9: Is it good idea to give all these arguments to one function?
displayUserDetails(id: Number){ // the id should be enough
}

//Q10: Who wants to have a function that do multiple things with multiple comments?
function evaluateStudents(studentsList) {
  let passedStudents = [];   
  const MINIMUM_GRADE_TO_PASS = 10; 
  studentsList.forEach((student) => {
    if (student.score >= MINIMUM_GRADE_TO_PASS) {
      passedStudents.push(student); 
    }}
  });

  return passedStudents; //the function should do one and only one clear task 
}
