//Q1: With this function we want to check if a1 is higher than a2 and less than a3 (No meaningful variables)
function compare(a1: Number, a2: Number, a3: Number): boolean {
  return a2 <= a1 && a1 <= a3;
}

//Q2: We want to have student type with some information. (If it's not pronounceable how you will say it)
type student = {
  firstName: String;
  lastName: String;
  age: number;
}

//Q3: What we should call our function that return User?
getUserData();
getUser();
getUserInformation();
//We shouls call this function "getUser();"

//Q4: We want to check if that our student yearly grade is acceptable for any country Education System (in Tunisia <20, in USA 100)
isGradeBelowMax(grade: Number,max:Number){
  return grade < max ; 
}

//Q5: I know you got the idea of variable names but I want it to be clear for anyone around the world.
Student student = new Student();
Grade grade = new Grade();
Professor professor = new Professor();

//Q6: Don't you think we are overdoing it???
Type Student {
studentFirstName: String;
studentLastName: String;
StudentId: Number;
}
//yes i think so ,
Type Student {
FirstName: String;
LastName: String;
Id: Number;
}

//Q7: What we can do to avoid giving unappropriat gender value? (Hint enum)
enum Gender{
male="Male"
female="Female"
}

Type Student {
firstName: String;
lastName: String;
Id: Number;
gender: Gender;
}

function displayName(student: Student){
switch (student.gender) {
    case "Male":
        console.log("Mr." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
        break;
    case "Female":
        console.log("Mrs." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
        break;
    Default:
        console.log("ERROR 404");
    }
}

//Q8: Is it good idea to display all these arguments in one line like this?

//No , it's not , i think this is better 
displayUserDetails(firstName: String, lastName: String, id: Number,
 department: String, university: String){
// Some logic happens here
}

//Q9: Is it good idea to give all these arguments to one function?
displayUserDetails(Student : student, department: String, university: String){
}



//Q10: Who wants to have a function that do multiple things with multiple comments?
