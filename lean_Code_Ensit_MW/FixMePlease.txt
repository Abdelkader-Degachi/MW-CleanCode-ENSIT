//Q1: With this function we want to check if a1 is higher than a2 and less than a3 (No meaningful variables)
function isValueInInterval(a1: Number, a2: Number, a3: Number): boolean {
  return a2 <= a1 && a1 <= a3;
}

//Q2: We want to have student type with some information. (If it's not pronounceable how you will say it)
type Student = {
  firstName: String;
  lastName: String;
  age: number;
};

//Q3: What we should call our function that return User?==> getUser(); ✓✓ 
getUserData();
getUser(); ✓✓
getUserInformation();

//Q4: We want to check if that our student yearly grade is acceptable for any country Education System (in Tunisia <20, in USA 100)
isGradeBelowMax(grade: Number,max:number){
  return grade < max ; 
}

//Q5: I know you got the idea of variable names but I want it to be clear for anyone around the world.
Student student = new Student();
Grade grade = new Grade();
Professor professor = new Professor();

//Q6: Don't you think we are overdoing it???
Type Student {
firstName: String;
lastName: String;
id: number;
}

//Q7: What we can do to avoid giving unappropriat gender value? (Hint enum)
enum Gender {
    Male = "Male",
    Female = "Female",
}
Type Student {
  firstName: String;
  lastName: String;
  Id: Number;
  gender: Gender;
}
function displayName(student: Student){
  switch (student.gender) {
    case gender.Male:
        console.log("Mr." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
        break;
    case gender.Female:
        console.log("Mrs." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
        break;
    Default:
        console.log("ERROR 404");
  }
}

//Q8: Is it good idea to display all these arguments in one line like this?
displayUserDetails(
  firstName: String, 
  lastName: String, 
  id: Number, 
  department: String, 
  university: String
){
    // Some logic happens here
 }
===>Readability of code is essential, and consolidating multiple media onto a single line 
can make it difficult to understand functional signatures.

//Q9: Is it good idea to give all these arguments to one function?
displayUserDetails(firstName: String, lastName: String, id: Number, department: String, university: String){
}
===> No, it's not a good idea to give all these arguments to one function:
displayUserDetails(
  student: Student, 
  department: String, 
  university: String
  ){
  
  }

//Q10: Who wants to have a function that do multiple things with multiple comments?
const MINIMUM_GRADE_TO_PASS = 10;

function displayMessage(student) {
  const genderPrefix = student.gender === Gender.Male ? "Mr." : "Mrs.";
  console.log(`Sorry ${genderPrefix} ${student.name}, you are suspended.`);
}

function hasPassed(student) {
  return student.score >= MINIMUM_GRADE_TO_PASS;
}

function handleSuspension(student){
  if (student.failedBefore) {
    displayMessage(student);
  } else {
    student.failedBefore = true;
  }
}

function evaluateStudents(studentsList) {
  let passedStudents = [];
  studentsList.forEach((student) => {
    if (hasPassed(student.score)) {
      passedStudents.push(student);
