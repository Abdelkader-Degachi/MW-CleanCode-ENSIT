//Q1: With this function we want to check if a1 is higher than a2 and less than a3 (No meaningful variables)
function between(nbre: Number, partie_inf: Number, partie_sup: Number): boolean {

type Student_details = {

//Q3: What we should call our function that return User?
getUser();

isGradeBelowMax(grade, 20)
function is_succeeded(grade:number,max:number): boolean
{return grade <= max;}

//Q5: I know you got the idea of variable names but I want it to be clear for anyone around the world.
Student student = new Student();

Professor professor = new Professor();

//Q6: Don't you think we are overdoing it???
Type Student {

//Q7: What we can do to avoid giving unappropriat gender value? (Hint enum)
enum Gender {
  male = "male",
  female = "female",
}

lastName: String;
Id: Number;

    case Gender.female:
        console.log("Mrs." + student.firstName + " " + student.lastName);
        break;
    Default:
        console.log("ERROR 404");
    }
}

//Q8: Is it good idea to display all these arguments in one line like this?
displayUserDetails(
firstName: String,
lastName: String,
id: Number,
department: String,
university: String){
// Some logic happens here
}

//Q9: Is it good idea to give all these arguments to one function?
displayUserDetails(firstName: String, lastName: String, id: Number, department: String, university: String){
}
No it's not
//Q10: Who wants to have a function that do multiple things with multiple comments?
